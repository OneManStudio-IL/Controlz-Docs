### Changes:

- **Fixed a bug with hub scanning on Android 12+** by requesting precise location permission.
- **Added option to hide/show the blocks palette** by clicking on the currently selected block collection.
- **Added a resize handle** to the blocks palette to allow **manual resizing**.
- **Fixed high CPU usage** when a profile was loaded but the program wasnâ€™t running.
- **Improved the "String list" block editor** to avoid content being cut off. Now items are split into columns for better visibility with large lists.
